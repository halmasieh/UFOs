# UFOs

## Project Overview
In this analysis, we begin our JavaScript journey by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization. 
JavaScript is typically known as a front end developement languge. This means that it adds extra functionality and customizations to enhance the user experience. 
Our focus is on a dynamic webpage which accept user inputs and adjust accordingly. 

We build a dynamic webpage by inserting a JavaSript into an HTML page using CSS and Bootstrap and exploring some Devtools to test our code as we go.
We start by building a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

We use basic HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to build and style the entire page. 
The project is done as follows: 
   - Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
   - A written report on the UFO analysis 


## Resources
Software: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JavaScript ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp)


## Results
We provide a dynamic webpage by allowing users to filter UFO sightings on multiple criterias at the same time. The table filters included for date, city, sate, country and shape. Bundled into one tidy package, every sighting would be available for Dana (and her readers) to view. Although the created table is well organized, it is huge 
with hundreds of rows which is entirely too much for one person to reasonably look through and study. Therefore, using the filter feature, this possibility is provided
for group or individual search and enables the user to see, for example, all data related to the first of May in the US country as below:

Furthurmore, filtering on the table can be done collectively on all the criterias and the result is shown in the table according to the specified inputs as below.

## Summary
Most of the websites we use these days are often dynamic websites. These dynamic websites have databases through which the content of a webpage is generated on the server dynamically and then sent to the user’s browser. Advantage of this is that each of the users get customized contents specific to them that are different from what would be delivered to other users. Contrary to this, a static website is usually made up of static content (mostly using only HTML & CSS) that are already stored as complete files on the server. Thus, each of the users who request a particular webpage from this server will always receive the same content. 

In addition, the cost of hosting a static website is in pennies compared to a dynamic website as it just needs a simple web enabled file server.
If you are just looking for simple blog type of website to operate at a cheap cost, you can definitely opt for a static website. On the other hand, if you are looking to create a website having thousands of web pages or contents that are to be customized specific to each user, then dynamic website is the way to go. Therefore the cost of creating dynamic webpages is far more than the cost for static website.

One of the of disadvantages of the created dynamic webpage is as follows:

In fact, creating a dynamic webpage with a filtered table that has separate options for each entry has caused the webpage to become crowded and cluttered. Instead, we can create a dropdown menu that gives us all the options by clicking once. 

We can make the dynamic webpage more user-friendly, therefore the recommendations to develope the dynamic webpage would be as follows:

1- Mobile optimization: With a continually increasing number of people accessing the internet on mobile, it is a requirement of a webpage  and all the content we produce should be mobile-optimized and responsive. There are two main things that come into play. A content that’s not mobile-optimized will load slowly on mobile devices, decreasing our chances for conversion. The second is about engagement. Having content that’s optimized for mobile means presenting experiences that are touch-ready. Users won’t need to zoom in to click.

2- The table of data contatins 7 columns that almost fills most of the dynamic webpage. To make the table more efficient, we can add the followings:
 
   - A dropdown menu toolbar in the top right corner of the page like:

   - Create other attractions like acount menu that includes email and name like:

   - Add the link to connect to Facebook, Linkdedln, Cloud and so on.

   - Add advertisements to attract more users.
   - Add small arrow beside the date to sort the date.
   - Add the contact link in the left corner of the page for those who wants to contact us and get more information.
   - Export filtered data as a resource for those who want to use this set of data later.
   - Change date to a period of time for example from 1/1/2010 -1/5/2010 which makes more facilities to the users.
   - Shorten the text inside the paragraph and add a "show more" link instead for those looking for more information.
